Looking back, I never realized I wanted to become a Software Developer. I always loved technology and how things were created and how they worked, but I never thought I would want a career where I was the person making that happen. I would say that it was a gradual realization. I feel like that desire was always there subconciously, but not there on the surface.

When I was really young, I used to play computer games on the family PC. At the time it was an IBM, but I can't remmeber the model. All I can remember is that I loved playing games. From simple preinstalled computer games like pinball and checkers to cd-rom computer games like The Sims and Tomb Raider. I was also fond on playing games on console as well. I am forever a " Sony Pony" and proud of it :).

As I got older, my interest peaked. I always liked creating websites and mini programs, but didnt realize that I was coding. I just saw it as fun, so I did it. Tech was always something I would do as a hobby. For a career, I wanted to become a Certified Nurse Midwife. When I graduated high school, I went to a 4 year private university to study to become a Nurse. After the first semester though, something changed. I started to lose interest for Nursing all together. I think it had to do with the possiblity that you could have a patient that could potentially die in front of you. For the career I wanted to pursue, that would be newborn babies. I knew I couldn't handle that.

I left that 4 year university and took a semester off from school to figure out what I wanted to do as a career. I was actually having a bit of a hard time figuring that out. I believed I didn't know what I was good at or what I wanted to do long term. I took to the Interet to figure out what careers would suit me. I remember plaaying Dragon Age for the first time in 2015 and thinking " Wow! I wish I could create a game like this". From there I started to research how to become a Game Developer. I would spend days and nights just bookmarking pages that I found helpful in my research. But since I knew the current climate of the gaming industry, I thought " maybe I could segway into the tech industry by being involved in IT. But I knew that becoming a Software Developer was my main goal.
